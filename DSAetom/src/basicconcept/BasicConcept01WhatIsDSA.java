	//a.uses of data structure: quick access of data
	//b. to break large problems into smaller
	
	//2. time and space complexity: algo is working how fast and how much memory is needed for it.
	
	//real ife ex.: 
	//a. O(n) time complexity: sup. we have 100 file and we have to search 1 file-- if we will search  1-1  it will  takes lots of time. Its VCalled O(n).
	//O(log n): if files are sorted and  using bimnry search , then it will take less time, which is called O(log n);
	
	//Space compexity: if we are using another memory to resolve a  problem. it cause SC.
	//ex. - if we r creating a new list and copy data, it takes extra memory.
	//ex if we want to search a person cont num in mobile. if list is sorted it will take less time, o9log n . 
	//if it is unsorted takes more time O(n).
	
	
	/*
	 * Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find a target value in a
	 * sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:
	 * 
	 * Start with the middle element of the list. If the target is equal to the
	 * middle element, you're done. If the target is smaller, repeat the search on
	 * the left half of the list. If the target is larger, repeat the search on the
	 * right half of the list. This process continues until the target is found or
	 * the search interval is empty.
	 * 
	 * Time Complexity: O(log n), meaning it takes much less time than checking
	 * every element one by one, especially with large lists.
