### **Java Multithreading Cheat Sheet with Detailed Explanations**

Multithreading in Java allows the execution of multiple threads concurrently. This feature helps improve the performance of applications by utilizing CPU resources more efficiently. Below is a comprehensive cheat sheet to help you understand multithreading concepts and usage in Java.

---

### **1. What is Multithreading?**

**Explanation**:
- **Multithreading** is the capability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently.
- A **thread** is a lightweight process, and each thread has its own execution path.
- In Java, **multithreading** allows Java programs to run multiple threads in parallel, which can lead to better resource utilization and improved performance for CPU-bound tasks.

---

### **2. Key Terminology**

- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process.
- **Process**: A process is a program in execution. It contains one or more threads.
- **Concurrency**: Running multiple tasks seemingly at the same time.
- **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks at the same time on multiple processors.

---

### **3. Thread Creation in Java**

There are **two primary ways** to create threads in Java:

#### **1. Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**

**Explanation**:  
A class implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides its `run()` method.

**Syntax**:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start();  // Starting the thread
    }
}
```

#### **2. Extending the `Thread` Class**

**Explanation**:  
A class extends the `Thread` class and overrides the `run()` method.

**Syntax**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();  // Starting the thread
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Thread Lifecycle**

A thread in Java has a lifecycle that consists of several states:
- **New**: A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: A thread is in this state when it is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
- **Blocked**: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a resource, such as I/O or a lock.
- **Waiting**: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for another thread to perform a specific action.
- **Timed Waiting**: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a specified period.
- **Terminated**: A thread has finished executing.

---

### **5. Thread States Methods**

- **`start()`**: Begins the execution of a thread.
- **`sleep(long millis)`**: Pauses the current thread for the specified time in milliseconds.
- **`join()`**: Makes the current thread wait until the thread it joins finishes.
- **`isAlive()`**: Checks if the thread is still alive.
- **`interrupt()`**: Interrupts the thread.

**Example**:
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);  // Sleep for 1 second
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});

t.start();
```

---

### **6. Synchronization in Java**

**Explanation**:  
In multithreading, **synchronization** is used to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time. It prevents thread interference and memory consistency errors.

- **`synchronized` Keyword**: Used to create a block or method that is synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.

#### **1. Synchronized Method**:
```java
public synchronized void syncMethod() {
    // Code here
}
```

#### **2. Synchronized Block**:
```java
public void syncBlock() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Code here
    }
}
```

**Example of synchronized method**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

---

### **7. Deadlock in Java**

**Explanation**:  
A **deadlock** is a situation in which two or more threads are blocked forever because each thread is holding a lock that the other thread is waiting for. This results in an infinite waiting cycle.

**Example**:
```java
class A {
    synchronized void methodA(B b) {
        b.last();
    }

    synchronized void last() {}
}

class B {
    synchronized void methodB(A a) {
        a.last();
    }

    synchronized void last() {}
}
```

To prevent deadlock, avoid nested locks or use **timeouts** when attempting to acquire locks.

---

### **8. Thread Pool in Java**

**Explanation**:  
A **thread pool** is a collection of pre-instantiated, idle threads which stand ready to be given work. It improves performance by reusing existing threads instead of creating a new one each time.

- **`ExecutorService`**: The main interface for managing thread pools.
- **`Executors`**: A utility class that provides factory methods for creating various types of thread pools.

**Example**:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);  // Thread pool with 2 threads

Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
executor.submit(task);
executor.shutdown();
```

---

### **9. Concurrency Utilities in Java**

Java provides a set of utilities to help with concurrency and thread synchronization:
- **`CountDownLatch`**: Allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations completes.
- **`CyclicBarrier`**: Allows threads to wait until all threads reach a common barrier point.
- **`Semaphore`**: Manages access to resources by multiple threads.
- **`ReentrantLock`**: A more flexible version of `synchronized` with additional features like try-lock.

**Example** (using `CountDownLatch`):
```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);  // Three threads to wait for

Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is working");
    latch.countDown();
};

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    executor.submit(task);
}

latch.await();  // Main thread waits for latch to reach zero
System.out.println("All threads are done!");
executor.shutdown();
```

---

### **10. Callable and Future in Java**

**Explanation**:  
The **`Callable`** interface is similar to `Runnable`, but it can return a result or throw an exception. The **`Future`** object represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

- **`Callable`**: A functional interface that can return a value.
- **`Future`**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

**Example**:
```java
Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 123;
};

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);

try {
    System.out.println(result.get());  // Output: 123 (waits for task to finish)
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

executor.shutdown();
```

---

### **11. Fork/Join Framework**

**Explanation**:  
The **Fork/Join** framework is used to recursively break down a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. It's particularly useful for tasks that can be divided into smaller parallel tasks.

- **`ForkJoinPool`**: A special implementation of `ExecutorService` that uses work-stealing algorithms to maximize CPU utilization.

**Example**:
```java
ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = new ForkJoinPool();
RecursiveTask<Integer> task = new RecursiveTask<>() {
    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        // Task implementation
        return 1;
    }
};
Integer result = forkJoinPool.invoke(task);
System.out.println(result);
```

### **Complete Java Multithreading Interview Questions with Explanations**

Here are some common and advanced multithreading interview questions along with their detailed explanations. These questions cover various aspects of Java multithreading and concurrency, including thread lifecycle, synchronization, thread pool, deadlock, and more.

---

### **1. What is Multithreading in Java?**

**Explanation**:
Multithreading in Java is a feature that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a program. Each thread represents a single path of execution, and using multithreading can improve the performance of applications, especially for CPU-bound tasks.

---

### **2. How do you create a thread in Java?**

**Explanation**:
There are two primary ways to create a thread in Java:

1. **By extending the `Thread` class**:
   - Create a new class that extends the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method.

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   MyThread t = new MyThread();
   t.start();  // Starts the thread
   ```

2. **By implementing the `Runnable` interface**:
   - Create a class that implements the `Runnable` interface and override the `run()` method.

   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   t.start();  // Starts the thread
   ```

---

### **3. What is the difference between `Runnable` and `Thread` in Java?**

**Explanation**:
- **`Runnable`**: It is a functional interface with a single method `run()`. It allows you to implement tasks that can be executed by a thread.
- **`Thread`**: It is a class that represents a thread. It provides methods like `start()`, `sleep()`, and `join()`.

You can either extend the `Thread` class or implement the `Runnable` interface. Using `Runnable` is preferred when your class already extends another class because Java allows multiple interface implementations but only single class inheritance.

---

### **4. What is the difference between `sleep()` and `wait()`?**

**Explanation**:
- **`sleep(long millis)`**: Makes the current thread sleep for the specified number of milliseconds. It is a static method of the `Thread` class.
- **`wait()`**: Used in synchronized blocks/methods to make the current thread wait until another thread sends a signal using `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.

```java
// sleep example
Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread will sleep for 1 second

// wait example
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait();  // Makes the current thread wait until notified
}
```

---

### **5. What is a deadlock, and how can it be avoided?**

**Explanation**:
A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever because they are waiting for each other to release resources. For example:

```java
class A {
    synchronized void methodA(B b) {
        b.last();
    }
    synchronized void last() {}
}

class B {
    synchronized void methodB(A a) {
        a.last();
    }
    synchronized void last() {}
}
```

**How to avoid deadlock**:
- **Avoid nested locks**: Try to avoid acquiring more than one lock at a time.
- **Use timeout**: Use methods like `tryLock()` in `ReentrantLock` to avoid indefinite waiting.
- **Use a lock hierarchy**: Always acquire locks in a consistent order to avoid circular dependencies.

---

### **6. What is thread synchronization in Java?**

**Explanation**:
Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. This helps to avoid inconsistent data and ensures thread safety.

- **`synchronized` keyword**: Used to restrict access to a block or method to only one thread at a time.

```java
public synchronized void syncMethod() {
    // Code here
}
```

---

### **7. What is the difference between `synchronized` method and `synchronized` block?**

**Explanation**:
- **Synchronized Method**: Locks the instance or class for the duration of the method execution.
- **Synchronized Block**: Locks a specific portion of the code, allowing you to be more granular with locking and reduce the performance overhead.

```java
// Synchronized Method
public synchronized void syncMethod() {
    // Code here
}

// Synchronized Block
public void syncBlock() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Code here
    }
}
```

---

### **8. What is a thread pool, and how does it work in Java?**

**Explanation**:
A **thread pool** is a collection of threads that are reused to perform multiple tasks. Instead of creating a new thread each time, the thread pool reuses existing threads, improving performance and resource management.

- **`ExecutorService`**: Provides methods for managing a pool of worker threads.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);  // Creates a thread pool with 3 threads
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
executor.submit(task);
executor.shutdown();  // Shut down the pool
```

---

### **9. What is the difference between `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`?**

**Explanation**:
- **`CountDownLatch`**: A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations completes.
  
  Example:
  ```java
  CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);  // Wait for 3 threads
  latch.countDown();  // Decrement latch count
  latch.await();  // Wait until count reaches 0
  ```

- **`CyclicBarrier`**: A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait until a common barrier point is reached.

  Example:
  ```java
  CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> System.out.println("All threads reached barrier"));
  barrier.await();  // Wait until 3 threads reach the barrier
  ```

---

### **10. What are `ReentrantLock` and `ReadWriteLock`?**

**Explanation**:
- **`ReentrantLock`**: A lock that allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.
  
  ```java
  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  lock.lock();  // Acquire lock
  lock.unlock();  // Release lock
  ```

- **`ReadWriteLock`**: A lock that allows multiple threads to read shared data concurrently, but only one thread can write at a time. It provides better performance for applications with a heavy read load.

  ```java
  ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
  Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
  Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();
  ```

---

### **11. What is a `Callable` in Java? How is it different from `Runnable`?**

**Explanation**:
- **`Callable`**: Similar to `Runnable`, but it can return a result or throw an exception. It is used with the `ExecutorService` to submit tasks.
  
  ```java
  Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
      return 123;
  };
  Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);
  ```

- **`Runnable`**: Cannot return a result or throw an exception.

---

### **12. How can you prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors?**

**Explanation**:
- **Thread interference**: Occurs when two or more threads access shared data simultaneously.
- **Memory consistency errors**: Happens when threads have inconsistent views of shared data.

To avoid these:
- Use **`synchronized`** blocks/methods to make sure only one thread can access a critical section.
- Use **`volatile`** keyword for variables to ensure proper visibility between threads.
- Use **`Atomic`** classes (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`) to perform thread-safe operations without explicit locking.

---

### **13. What is the Fork/Join Framework in Java?**

**Explanation**:
The **Fork/Join** framework is used to process tasks that can be broken down into smaller sub-tasks, which can be executed in parallel. It is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package.

- **`ForkJoinPool`**: Manages worker threads that can execute tasks in parallel.
- **`RecursiveTask`**: A task that returns a result.
- **`RecursiveAction`**: A task that does not return a result.
