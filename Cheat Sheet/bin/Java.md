# Introduction to Java Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Overview and History of Java**

**Java** is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that was developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle). It was first released in **1995**. Java's core philosophy is **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**, meaning that once a program is written in Java, it can run on any platform without modification.

### 2. **Features of Java**

Java offers several important features:
- **Simple**: Java syntax is easy to understand, especially for those familiar with C and C++.
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is an object, which helps in organizing code efficiently.
- **Platform-Independent**: Java programs can run on any platform with a JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- **Robust**: Java has strong memory management and exception-handling mechanisms, making it less prone to errors.
- **Secure**: Java provides a secure environment through the use of classloaders, bytecode verification, and security managers.
- **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
- **Distributed Computing**: Java has built-in support for networking and remote communication, making it suitable for distributed applications.
- **High Performance**: Java's performance is enhanced through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and optimizations.

### 3. **JDK, JRE, and JVM**

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE, development tools, and compilers.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: JRE provides the libraries and components required to run Java programs. It does not include development tools like compilers.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: JVM is responsible for running Java programs. It interprets compiled Java bytecode and executes it on the host machine.

```text
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JRE = JVM + Libraries
```

### 4. **Understanding the Java Development Kit (JDK)**

The **JDK** is a complete development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes:
- **JVM**: Executes Java programs.
- **Java Compiler**: Converts Java source code into bytecode.
- **Java Debugger**: Helps debug Java programs.
- **Java API Libraries**: Standard libraries providing pre-written code for common tasks like networking, file I/O, etc.

To install Java:
1. Download the JDK from the official Java website.
2. Set up environment variables like `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` to enable running Java commands from any directory.

### 5. **Hello World Program in Java**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the HelloWorld Program:
- `public class HelloWorld`: Declares the class `HelloWorld` as public (accessible from anywhere).
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: The main method is the entry point of the Java program.
- `System.out.println()`: Prints the output to the console.

### 6. **Java Syntax and Data Types**

Java uses the following basic data types:
- **int**: Integer type.
- **double**: Floating-point type for decimals.
- **char**: Stores a single character.
- **boolean**: Stores `true` or `false`.
- **String**: Stores a sequence of characters (not a primitive type).

```java
int num = 10;
double price = 19.99;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isJavaFun = true;
String name = "John Doe";
```

### 7. **Control Flow in Java**

Java provides control flow statements such as:
- **if, else if, else**: Conditional statements.
- **switch**: Multi-way branch statement.
- **for, while, do-while**: Looping statements.

```java
// if-else example
int number = 10;
if (number > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is less than or equal to 5");
}

// for loop example
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Provides libraries and components required to run Java programs. It includes the JVM but lacks development tools.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Responsible for interpreting bytecode and executing Java programs on a specific platform.

### 3. **What are the main features of Java?**

**Answer**: Java is simple, object-oriented, platform-independent, robust, secure, multithreaded, distributed, and high-performance. These features make Java suitable for building a wide range of applications.

### 4. **What is the difference between a class and an object?**

**Answer**: 
- A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object.
- An **object** is an instance of a class, with its own specific data (attributes) and methods (behaviors).

### 5. **What is the meaning of “Write Once, Run Anywhere”?**

**Answer**: Java programs can be written once and run on any platform without modification because of its platform independence. This is possible through the JVM, which converts the bytecode to platform-specific instructions.

### 6. **What are the advantages of using Java?**

**Answer**: The advantages of Java include:
- **Platform Independence**: Java code can run on any machine with a JVM.
- **Security**: Java has built-in security features to protect against viruses and unauthorized access.
- **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing for efficient execution of concurrent tasks.
- **Rich API**: Java has a vast library of classes and functions for various tasks like networking, file I/O, and GUI development.

### 7. **What is the role of the JVM in the execution of a Java program?**

**Answer**: The **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) interprets the compiled bytecode and executes it on the host machine. The JVM is what makes Java platform-independent by converting bytecode into machine-specific code.

### 8. **What are some basic data types in Java?**

**Answer**: Java has primitive data types, including:
- **int**: Integer type for whole numbers.
- **double**: Floating-point number type for decimals.
- **char**: Character type for storing single characters.
- **boolean**: Boolean type for `true` or `false`.
- **String**: Sequence of characters.

### 9. **What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- `==` compares **references** (whether two variables point to the same object in memory).
- `equals()` compares the **contents** of objects (whether two objects have the same state).

### 10. **What is a constructor in Java?**

**Answer**: A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. Constructors have the same name as the class and no return type. There are two types of constructors:
- **Default Constructor**: Provided by Java when no constructor is defined.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Defined by the developer to initialize an object with specific values.

# Java Basics Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Writing a Simple Java Program**

A simple Java program has a basic structure:

```java
public class SimpleProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print "Hello, Java!" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```

- **public class**: Declares the class.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: The main method is the entry point of a Java application. The program starts executing from here.
- **System.out.println()**: Prints the message to the console.

### 2. **Data Types and Variables**

Java provides two types of data types:
- **Primitive Data Types**: These are basic types like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
- **Reference Data Types**: These include objects, arrays, and interfaces.

#### Primitive Data Types:
- **byte**: 1 byte, range: -128 to 127
- **short**: 2 bytes, range: -32,768 to 32,767
- **int**: 4 bytes, range: -2^31 to 2^31-1
- **long**: 8 bytes, range: -2^63 to 2^63-1
- **float**: 4 bytes, stores decimal values
- **double**: 8 bytes, stores larger decimal values
- **char**: 2 bytes, stores a single character
- **boolean**: 1 byte, stores true or false

```java
int age = 25; // integer data type
double price = 19.99; // double data type
boolean isActive = true; // boolean data type
char grade = 'A'; // char data type
```

#### Reference Data Types:
- **String**: A sequence of characters.
- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type.
- **Object**: Instances of classes.

```java
String name = "John"; // String data type
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}; // Array
```

### 3. **Java Keywords**

Java keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings. Some important Java keywords are:
- **class**: Defines a class.
- **public**: Access modifier, makes classes and methods accessible from anywhere.
- **private**: Access modifier, restricts access to class members.
- **static**: Defines class-level methods or variables.
- **void**: Indicates that a method does not return a value.
- **new**: Used to create new objects.
- **if, else**: Conditional statements.
- **for, while, do**: Looping statements.
- **try, catch**: Exception handling keywords.

### 4. **Naming Conventions**

Java has some standard naming conventions that help in making code readable:
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use **PascalCase** (first letter capitalized, e.g., `MyClass`, `UserDetails`).
- **Methods and Variables**: Use **camelCase** (first letter lowercase, e.g., `calculateTotal`, `userName`).
- **Constants**: Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (uppercase letters with underscores, e.g., `MAX_VALUE`).

### 5. **Command-line Arguments**

Command-line arguments allow users to pass information to a program when it is executed. These arguments are passed as an array of strings (`String[] args`) to the `main` method.

```java
public class CommandLineExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing command-line arguments
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0]); // Prints first argument
        } else {
            System.out.println("No arguments passed!");
        }
    }
}
```

To run the program with arguments:
```bash
java CommandLineExample John
```

### 6. **Operators**

Java provides several types of operators to perform operations on variables and values.

#### Arithmetic Operators:
Used for mathematical calculations.
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

```java
int a = 10, b = 5;
System.out.println(a + b); // Addition, Output: 15
System.out.println(a - b); // Subtraction, Output: 5
```

#### Logical Operators:
Used to perform logical operations.
- `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

```java
boolean x = true, y = false;
System.out.println(x && y); // AND, Output: false
System.out.println(x || y); // OR, Output: true
```

#### Bitwise Operators:
Used for bit-level operations.
- `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`

```java
int x = 5, y = 3;
System.out.println(x & y); // Bitwise AND, Output: 1
```

#### Relational Operators:
Used to compare values.
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

```java
int a = 10, b = 20;
System.out.println(a == b); // Equality, Output: false
```

#### Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` 

```java
int a = 10;
a += 5; // Equivalent to a = a + 5
System.out.println(a); // Output: 15
```

### 7. **Type Casting**

Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another. There are two types:
- **Implicit Casting (Widening)**: Automatically done by Java when converting from a smaller type to a larger type.
- **Explicit Casting (Narrowing)**: Requires manual conversion when going from a larger type to a smaller type.

```java
// Implicit casting (widening)
int a = 10;
double b = a; // int to double

// Explicit casting (narrowing)
double x = 9.78;
int y = (int) x; // double to int
System.out.println(y); // Output: 9
```

# Interview Questions on Java Basics

### 1. **What are the different types of data types in Java?**

**Answer**: Java has **primitive data types** like `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, and **reference data types** like `String`, arrays, and objects.

### 2. **What is the difference between primitive and reference data types?**

**Answer**:
- **Primitive types** store the actual value (e.g., `int`, `char`).
- **Reference types** store references to objects in memory (e.g., `String`, arrays).

### 3. **What are Java keywords?**

**Answer**: Java keywords are predefined, reserved words that have special meaning in the language, like `class`, `public`, `static`, `private`, `if`, `else`, etc.

### 4. **What is the purpose of the `main` method in Java?**

**Answer**: The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. It is where the program starts executing.

### 5. **What is type casting in Java?**

**Answer**: Type casting is converting one data type into another. Java supports both **implicit casting** (automated, widening) and **explicit casting** (manual, narrowing).

### 6. **What are the operators in Java?**

**Answer**: Java operators include:
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

- **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

### 7. **What is the use of command-line arguments in Java?**

**Answer**: Command-line arguments allow users to pass information to a program when it is executed. These are received as an array of `String` arguments in the `main` method.

### 8. **What are naming conventions in Java?**

**Answer**: Java follows naming conventions:
- **Classes** and **Interfaces**: **PascalCase** (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Methods** and **Variables**: **camelCase** (e.g., `calculateSum`).
- **Constants**: **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`).

### 9. **How do you write a simple Java program?**

**Answer**: A simple Java program includes the definition of a class with the `main` method. The program starts executing from the `main` method, and you can use `System.out.println()` to print output to the console.

### 10. **What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?**

**Answer**: 
- `==` compares memory references (whether two variables point to the same object).
- `equals()` compares the **content** of objects (whether two objects have the same state).

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Class and Object**

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines properties and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class that holds data and methods to perform actions on the data.

```java
// Class definition
class Car {
    String model;
    int year;
    
    // Method
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Creating an object
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car(); // Creating an object
        car.model = "Toyota";
        car.year = 2020;
        car.displayInfo(); // Calling method on object
    }
}
```

### 2. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit known as class. It hides the internal state and requires interaction only through getter and setter methods.

```java
class Person {
    private String name; // Private variable

    // Getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Abstraction**

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It is achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog();
        animal.sound(); // Output: Bark
    }
}
```

### 4. **Inheritance**

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits the properties and methods of an existing class (superclass).

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited method
        dog.bark(); // Dog's own method
    }
}
```

### 5. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism in Java
Polymorphism is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It means "many forms" and refers to the ability of an object to take on different forms. In simple terms, polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different types of tasks. It makes your code more flexible and reusable.

Types of Polymorphism
Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
1. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
Method Overloading is when you define multiple methods in the same class with the same name, but with different parameters (either different number of parameters or different types of parameters). The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature (name and parameters).

Key Points:
The method name is the same, but the parameter list is different.
It happens during compile time.
It does not depend on the object but on the method signature.
Example of Method Overloading:

```java

class MathOperations {

    // Method for adding two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method for adding three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method for adding two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```


```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        
        // Calling the method with two integers
        System.out.println(math.add(10, 20));  // Output: 30
        
        // Calling the method with three integers
        System.out.println(math.add(10, 20, 30));  // Output: 60
        
        // Calling the method with two doubles
        System.out.println(math.add(10.5, 20.5));  // Output: 31.0
    }
}

```
In the example above, the add method is overloaded to perform addition with different numbers of parameters and different data types (integers and doubles).

When is Method Overloading Used?
When you want to perform the same action with different types of data.
When the method's purpose remains the same, but you need to process different inputs.
2. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
Method Overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. In method overriding, the method signature (name, return type, and parameters) in both the parent class and child class must be the same. The JVM determines which method to call at runtime, depending on the type of object (parent or child class).

Key Points:
The method name and parameters must be the same in both the parent and child classes.
It occurs at runtime.
It allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method.
Example of Method Overriding:

```java
class Animal {
    // Method in parent class
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding the method in the subclass
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal();
        animal.sound();  // Output: Animal makes a sound
        
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```
In this example, the sound method in the Dog class overrides the sound method of the Animal class. Although the object dog is of type Animal, the sound method of the Dog class is called because the object is actually an instance of Dog.

When is Method Overriding Used?
When you want to change the behavior of an inherited method.
When a subclass needs to provide its own specific implementation for a method defined in the parent class.
Key Differences Between Method Overloading and Method Overriding
Feature	Method Overloading	Method Overriding
Definition	Same method name, but different parameter list.	Same method name and parameters, but different implementation in subclass.
Occurs	Compile-time polymorphism.	Runtime polymorphism.
Method Signature	Must differ in parameters.	Must be the same in both parent and child classes.
Return Type	Can be the same or different.	Must be the same as in the parent class.
Purpose	Used to perform similar operations on different data types or numbers of arguments.	Used to modify or extend the functionality of an inherited method.
Summary of Polymorphism, Method Overloading, and Method Overriding
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common supertype. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
Method Overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name exist but with different parameters. It helps perform the same action with different types or numbers of inputs.
Method Overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. It allows you to modify or extend the behavior of a parent class method.
Example Code Summary:
Method Overloading: Same method name, but different parameters or data types.
Method Overriding: Same method name and parameters, but different behavior in subclass.
```

### 6. **this Keyword**

The `this` keyword refers to the current object. It is often used to refer to the current class’s instance variables.

```java
class Student {
    String name;
    
    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name; // Refers to the current object's name variable
    }
}
```

### 7. **super Keyword**

The `super` keyword refers to the parent class’s constructor or methods. It is used to call the superclass’s constructor or methods.

```java
class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal constructor");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super(); // Calls parent class constructor
        System.out.println("Dog constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog(); // Output: Animal constructor, Dog constructor
    }
}
```

### 8. **Constructors: Default, Parameterized, Copy Constructor**

- **Default Constructor**: Automatically created by the compiler if no constructor is provided.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Allows initialization of objects with specific values.
- **Copy Constructor**: Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

```java
class Person {
    String name;

    // Default constructor
    Person() {
        name = "John Doe";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    Person(Person other) {
        this.name = other.name;
    }
}
```

### 9. **Method Overloading and Overriding**

- **Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters.
- **Overriding**: Same method name and same parameters but in a subclass.

```java
// Method Overloading
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Method Overriding
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

### 10. **Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers determine the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. There are four types:

- **public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
- **default (no modifier)**: Accessible within the same package.

```java
class Example {
    public int publicVar;
    private int privateVar;
    protected int protectedVar;
    int defaultVar; // default access

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Public: " + publicVar);
        System.out.println("Private: " + privateVar);
        System.out.println("Protected: " + protectedVar);
        System.out.println("Default: " + defaultVar);
    }
}
```

# 10 Interview Questions on OOP

### 1. **What is the difference between a class and an object?**

**Answer**: 
- A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties and behaviors. 
- An **object** is an instance of a class, containing real values for the class properties.

### 2. **What is encapsulation in OOP?**

**Answer**: 
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It hides the internal state of the object and only exposes the necessary methods to interact with it.

### 3. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**

**Answer**: 
- **Abstraction** focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only essential features of the object.
- **Encapsulation** involves bundling the data and methods in a single class and restricting access to some of the object's components.

### 4. **What is inheritance in OOP?**

**Answer**: 
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

### 5. **What is polymorphism?**

**Answer**: 
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types. It is achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

### 6. **What is the use of the `this` keyword in Java?**

**Answer**: 
The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate instance variables from local variables and to call the constructor of the same class.

### 7. **What is method overloading?**

**Answer**: 
Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both).

### 8. **What is method overriding?**

**Answer**: 
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

### 9. **What is a constructor in Java?**

**Answer**: 
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created. There are default constructors (provided by Java) and parameterized constructors (defined by the user).

### 10. **What are the types of access modifiers in Java?**

**Answer**: 
Java has four types of access modifiers:
- **public**: Accessible from any other class.
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
- **default**: Accessible only within the same package.

# Classes and Objects Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Defining and Instantiating Classes**

In Java, **a class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of an object. **An object** is an instance of a class.

#### Syntax to define a class:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (attributes)
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor to initialize object
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

#### Instantiating (creating) objects:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of class Car
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
        car1.displayInfo(); // Output: Model: Toyota, Year: 2020
    }
}
```

- **Class**: `Car` is a class.
- **Object**: `car1` is an object (instance) of the `Car` class.

### 2. **Static Members and Methods**

Static members belong to the class itself, not instances of the class. They are shared among all objects of the class.

#### Syntax for Static Member:

```java
public class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Static variable

    // Static method
    public static void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter.increment();
        System.out.println(Counter.count); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

- **Static Variable**: `count` is a static variable that is shared among all instances.
- **Static Method**: `increment()` is a static method that can be called without creating an object.

### 3. **Nested Classes**

A **nested class** is a class defined within another class. There are two types of nested classes:
1. **Static Nested Class**: Defined using the `static` keyword.
2. **Non-static Nested Class (Inner Class)**: Defined without the `static` keyword.

#### Example of Static Nested Class:

```java
public class OuterClass {
    static int outerValue = 10;

    // Static Nested Class
    static class NestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Outer value: " + outerValue); // Can access static outer class variables
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass.NestedClass nested = new OuterClass.NestedClass();
        nested.display(); // Output: Outer value: 10
    }
}
```

#### Example of Inner Class (Non-static Nested Class):

```java
public class OuterClass {
    int outerValue = 5;

    // Non-static Inner Class
    class InnerClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Outer value: " + outerValue); // Can access non-static outer class variables
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
        inner.display(); // Output: Outer value: 5
    }
}
```

### 4. **Anonymous Inner Classes**

An **anonymous inner class** is a local class without a name. It is used to instantiate and implement an interface or extend a class in a single expression.

#### Syntax for Anonymous Inner Class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Anonymous inner class implementing an interface
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Running in an anonymous inner class!");
            }
        };
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

- Here, `Runnable` is implemented anonymously without creating a new class.

### 5. **Packages and import Keyword**

**Packages** are used to group related classes and interfaces. The `import` keyword is used to bring classes from other packages into your current file.

#### Syntax for defining a package:

```java
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("This is MyClass from mypackage!");
    }
}
```

#### Syntax for importing a class:

```java
import mypackage.MyClass;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show(); // Output: This is MyClass from mypackage!
    }
}
```

- **`import`**: The `import` keyword allows using classes from different packages.
- **Package Declaration**: `package mypackage;` declares the package for the `MyClass` class.

# Interview Questions on Classes and Objects

### 1. **What is a class in Java?**

**Answer**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that describe an object.

### 2. **What is an object in Java?**

**Answer**: An object is an instance of a class. It contains values for the properties defined in the class and can call the methods to perform actions.

### 3. **What is the difference between a static and non-static method in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **Static methods** belong to the class itself, not instances. They can be called without creating an object.
- **Non-static methods** belong to an instance of the class, and you need an object to call these methods.

### 4. **What is a static variable in Java?**

**Answer**: A static variable is shared by all instances of a class. It is associated with the class itself, not the individual objects, and can be accessed without creating an object.

### 5. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in Java?**

**Answer**: The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables when they have the same name.

### 6. **What is a constructor in Java?**

**Answer**: A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

### 7. **What are nested classes in Java?**

**Answer**: A nested class is a class defined within another class. There are two types:
- **Static Nested Class**: Defined with `static`.
- **Inner Class**: Defined without `static`, it has access to the outer class's instance variables.

### 8. **What is the difference between an inner class and a static nested class?**

**Answer**: 
- **Inner Class**: A non-static class that can access the instance variables of the outer class.
- **Static Nested Class**: A static class that cannot access instance variables of the outer class.

### 9. **What is an anonymous inner class in Java?**

**Answer**: An anonymous inner class is a local class with no name. It is defined at the time of object creation and is used when a class is needed only once, such as when implementing an interface or extending a class.

### 10. **How does the `import` keyword work in Java?**

**Answer**: The `import` keyword is used to bring classes or entire packages into the current file, allowing you to use them without specifying their full package name.

Here’s a detailed cheat sheet for **Arrays and Strings** in Java, with clear definitions, code examples, and 10 interview questions with easy-to-understand answers at the end.

---

# Arrays and Strings Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Introduction to Arrays**

An **array** in Java is a container that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. Arrays are indexed starting from 0. Arrays can store primitive data types or objects.

#### Declaring and Initializing an Array:

```java
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declares an array of integers with 5 elements
arr[0] = 10; // Initializing the first element
arr[1] = 20; // Initializing the second element
```

You can also initialize an array at the time of declaration:

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Array initialization with values
```

### 2. **Single-Dimensional and Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

#### Single-Dimensional Arrays:

A single-dimensional array stores a list of values of the same type.

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
```

#### Multi-Dimensional Arrays:

A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays. Typically, a 2D array is used to represent a matrix.

```java
int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
System.out.println(matrix[1][2]); // Output: 6 (second row, third column)
```

### 3. **String Handling: String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder Classes**

Java provides three main classes for handling strings:
- **String**: Immutable (cannot be changed).
- **StringBuffer**: Mutable (can be changed, thread-safe).
- **StringBuilder**: Mutable (can be changed, not thread-safe).

#### String:

A **String** in Java is an object that represents a sequence of characters.

```java
String str = "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(str); // Output: Hello, World!
```

#### StringBuffer:

A **StringBuffer** is a mutable string that can be modified. It is **thread-safe**, meaning it can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment.

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sb.append(", World!"); // Modifies the StringBuffer object
System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!
```

#### StringBuilder:

A **StringBuilder** is similar to StringBuffer but is **not thread-safe** and is generally faster.

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(", World!"); // Modifies the StringBuilder object
System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### 4. **String Methods and Operations**

Here are some commonly used **String** methods:

#### `length()`: Returns the length of the string.

```java
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length()); // Output: 5
```

#### `charAt(int index)`: Returns the character at the specified index.

```java
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.charAt(1)); // Output: e
```

#### `substring(int start, int end)`: Returns a new string that is a substring from `start` index to `end` index.

```java
String str = "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(str.substring(0, 5)); // Output: Hello
```

#### `equals(Object obj)`: Compares the string with the specified object for equality.

```java
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); // Output: true
```

#### `replace(char oldChar, char newChar)`: Replaces all occurrences of the old character with the new one.

```java
String str = "Hello, World!";
System.out.println(str.replace('o', '0')); // Output: Hell0, W0rld!
```

#### `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`: Converts the string to uppercase or lowercase.

```java
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO
System.out.println(str.toLowerCase()); // Output: hello
```

### 5. **Character Methods**

Java provides several methods to manipulate characters, primarily in the `Character` class:

#### `charAt(int index)`: Returns the character at the specified index in a string.

```java
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.charAt(2)); // Output: l
```

#### `length()`: Returns the number of characters in the string.

```java
String str = "Java";
System.out.println(str.length()); // Output: 4
```

#### `substring(int beginIndex)`: Returns a substring starting from the specified index to the end.

```java
String str = "Programming";
System.out.println(str.substring(3)); // Output: ramming
```

# Interview Questions on Arrays and Strings

### 1. **What is an array in Java?**

**Answer**: An array in Java is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The values are stored in contiguous memory locations.

### 2. **What is the difference between a single-dimensional and a multi-dimensional array in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **Single-dimensional array** is a list of elements of the same type.
- **Multi-dimensional array** is an array of arrays, used for representing matrices or tables (e.g., a 2D array).

### 3. **What is the `charAt()` method in Java?**

**Answer**: The `charAt(int index)` method returns the character at the specified index in a string. Indexing starts from 0.

```java
String str = "Hello";
char result = str.charAt(1); // Output: 'e'
```

### 4. **What is the difference between `String`, `StringBuffer`, and `StringBuilder` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **String**: Immutable, meaning its content cannot be changed after creation.
- **StringBuffer**: Mutable and thread-safe, used when you need to modify a string in a multi-threaded environment.
- **StringBuilder**: Mutable and not thread-safe, typically used in single-threaded environments where performance is a concern.

### 5. **What does the `length()` method of a string do in Java?**

**Answer**: The `length()` method returns the number of characters present in a string, excluding the null-terminator.

```java
String str = "Hello";
int length = str.length(); // Output: 5
```

### 6. **What is the difference between `equals()` and `==` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- `equals()` compares the **content** of two strings to check if they are equal.
- `==` compares the **references** of two strings, i.e., whether they point to the same memory location.

### 7. **How do you create a multi-dimensional array in Java?**

**Answer**: A multi-dimensional array is created by defining an array of arrays. Example of a 2D array:

```java
int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
```

### 8. **What does the `substring()` method do in Java?**

**Answer**: The `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` method returns a new string that is a part of the original string starting from `beginIndex` and up to (but not including) `endIndex`.

### 9. **How do you reverse a string in Java?**

**Answer**: You can reverse a string using the `StringBuffer` or `StringBuilder` class's `reverse()` method.

```java
String str = "Hello";
String reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(); // Output: olleH
```

### 10. **What is the significance of the `replace()` method in Java?**

**Answer**: The `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another character in a string.

```java
String str = "Hello World!";
String replaced = str.replace('o', '0'); // Output: Hell0 W0rld!
```

# Exception Handling Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Types of Exceptions: Checked and Unchecked**

#### Checked Exceptions:
Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. These exceptions must either be handled using a try-catch block or declared using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.

Examples of checked exceptions: `IOException`, `SQLException`.

#### Unchecked Exceptions:
Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. These exceptions are subclasses of `RuntimeException`. You don't need to explicitly handle or declare them.

Examples of unchecked exceptions: `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### 2. **try, catch, finally Blocks**

In Java, exceptions are handled using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.

#### Syntax of try-catch:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // Example: Divide by zero
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handling exception
    System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    // Code that will always execute, whether an exception occurs or not
    System.out.println("This block always executes");
}
```

- **try**: The block where code that may throw an exception is placed.
- **catch**: The block where exceptions are handled.
- **finally**: The block that always executes, even if an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup code, such as closing resources.

### 3. **Throwing and Catching Exceptions (throw and throws)**

#### `throw` keyword:
The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception in Java. You can throw both checked and unchecked exceptions.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void checkAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is valid");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        checkAge(15); // This will throw an exception
    }
}
```

- The `throw` keyword is used to throw a new exception.

#### `throws` keyword:
The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw one or more exceptions. It is used for checked exceptions.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void riskyMethod() throws IOException {
        throw new IOException("An IO error occurred");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            riskyMethod(); // Handling the exception thrown by riskyMethod
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- **`throws`**: Declares that a method might throw an exception, which needs to be caught or handled by the caller.

### 4. **Creating Custom Exceptions**

Java allows you to create your own exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

#### Creating a Custom Exception:

```java
// Define a custom exception by extending Exception class
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message); // Call the parent class constructor with the error message
    }
}

public class MyClass {
    public static void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or older");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is valid");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkAge(15); // This will throw the custom exception
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

- **Custom Exception**: You can create a custom exception by extending the `Exception` class or `RuntimeException` for unchecked exceptions.

# Interview Questions on Exception Handling

### 1. **What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**

**Answer**:
- **Checked exceptions** are exceptions that are checked during compile-time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`). They must either be handled or declared using the `throws` keyword.
- **Unchecked exceptions** are exceptions that occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`). These are not checked at compile-time.

### 2. **What is the purpose of the `try-catch` block in Java?**

**Answer**: The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The code that may throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the exception is caught and handled in the `catch` block.

### 3. **What is the `finally` block used for in exception handling?**

**Answer**: The `finally` block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup tasks, like closing file streams or database connections.

### 4. **What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?**

**Answer**:
- **`throw`** is used to explicitly throw an exception inside a method or block of code.
- **`throws`** is used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw one or more exceptions, which must be handled by the caller.

### 5. **Can we catch a `Throwable` in Java?**

**Answer**: Yes, we can catch `Throwable`, but it is not recommended. `Throwable` is the superclass of all errors and exceptions. Catching `Throwable` will also catch `Error` objects (like `OutOfMemoryError`), which are usually not meant to be handled.

### 6. **What is the `NullPointerException` in Java?**

**Answer**: A `NullPointerException` occurs when you attempt to use a reference that points to `null`. For example, calling a method or accessing a property on a `null` object.

### 7. **What is the purpose of the `catch` block in exception handling?**

**Answer**: The `catch` block is used to catch exceptions thrown in the `try` block. It specifies the type of exception to catch and contains the code to handle the exception.

### 8. **What is a custom exception in Java?**

**Answer**: A custom exception is an exception that you define by extending the `Exception` class or `RuntimeException`. You can create your own exception types to represent specific error scenarios in your application.

### 9. **Can we have multiple `catch` blocks for a single `try` block?**

**Answer**: Yes, you can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately. The first `catch` block that matches the exception will be executed.

```java
try {
    // code
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle IOException
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // Handle SQLException
}
```

### 10. **What happens if an exception is not handled?**

**Answer**: If an exception is not handled within a method, it propagates to the caller method. If it is not caught at any level, the program will terminate and print a stack trace showing where the exception occurred.

# Collections Framework Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Introduction to Collections**

The **Collections Framework** in Java provides a set of interfaces and classes to store, manage, and manipulate collections of objects. It is part of the **java.util** package and includes classes for lists, sets, maps, and queues.

- **Interfaces**: Define the common operations that collections support (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`).
- **Classes**: Provide concrete implementations of these interfaces (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`).
- **Algorithms**: Support algorithms like sorting, searching, and manipulation.

### 2. **List Interface: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`**

The **List** interface allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order. It is implemented by `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

#### `ArrayList`:

An **ArrayList** is a resizable array implementation of the `List` interface. It allows fast random access and is suitable for storing large amounts of data.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(10);
list.add(20);
list.add(30);

System.out.println(list); // Output: [10, 20, 30]
```

#### `LinkedList`:

A **LinkedList** is a doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` interface. It provides faster insertion and deletion compared to `ArrayList`, but slower access to elements.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");
list.add("Orange");

System.out.println(list); // Output: [Apple, Banana, Orange]
```

### 3. **Set Interface: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`**

The **Set** interface does not allow duplicate elements and does not guarantee any specific order.

#### `HashSet`:

A **HashSet** is the most common implementation of the `Set` interface. It does not guarantee any order of elements.

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add(10);
set.add(20);
set.add(10); // Duplicate, won't be added

System.out.println(set); // Output: [10, 20]
```

#### `LinkedHashSet`:

A **LinkedHashSet** maintains the insertion order of elements.

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

LinkedHashSet<Integer> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
set.add(10);
set.add(20);
set.add(30);

System.out.println(set); // Output: [10, 20, 30]
```

#### `TreeSet`:

A **TreeSet** stores elements in a **sorted** order, using their natural ordering or a comparator.

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(30);
set.add(10);
set.add(20);

System.out.println(set); // Output: [10, 20, 30]
```

### 4. **Map Interface: `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`**

The **Map** interface stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Maps allow fast lookups based on the key.

#### `HashMap`:

A **HashMap** stores key-value pairs without any ordering of keys.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(2, "Banana");

System.out.println(map); // Output: {1=Apple, 2=Banana}
```

#### `LinkedHashMap`:

A **LinkedHashMap** maintains the insertion order of keys.

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;

LinkedHashMap<Integer, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(2, "Banana");

System.out.println(map); // Output: {1=Apple, 2=Banana}
```

#### `TreeMap`:

A **TreeMap** stores keys in a sorted order.

```java
import java.util.TreeMap;

TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(3, "Cherry");
map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(2, "Banana");

System.out.println(map); // Output: {1=Apple, 2=Banana, 3=Cherry}
```

### 5. **Queue Interface: `PriorityQueue`, `Deque`**

The **Queue** interface is used to represent a collection of elements that are processed in a FIFO (First In, First Out) manner.

#### `PriorityQueue`:

A **PriorityQueue** stores elements in a priority order based on their natural ordering or a comparator.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

PriorityQueue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
queue.add(30);
queue.add(10);
queue.add(20);

System.out.println(queue); // Output: [10, 30, 20] (Sorted order)
```

#### `Deque`:

A **Deque** (Double-Ended Queue) allows elements to be added or removed from both ends. It can be used as a stack or a queue.

```java
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

ArrayDeque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
deque.add("First");
deque.addFirst("Zero");
deque.addLast("Second");

System.out.println(deque); // Output: [Zero, First, Second]
```

### 6. **Iterators and Streams**

#### **Iterator**:

An **Iterator** is an object used to iterate over a collection, such as a `List`, `Set`, or `Map`.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");

Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iterator.next());
}
// Output:
// Apple
// Banana
```

#### **Streams**:

Streams provide a way to perform functional-style operations on collections (e.g., filtering, mapping, reducing).

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 2 4
```

### 1. **What is the Collections Framework in Java?**

**Answer**: The **Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces in the **java.util** package that implement commonly used data structures and algorithms. It provides efficient ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, and includes interfaces like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Queue`.

### 2. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **ArrayList**: It is backed by an array, providing fast access and retrieval of elements but slower insertion and deletion.
- **LinkedList**: It is backed by a doubly-linked list, providing faster insertions and deletions but slower access and retrieval compared to `ArrayList`.

### 3. **What is a `HashSet` in Java?**

**Answer**: A **HashSet** is a collection that implements the `Set` interface. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not guarantee any specific order of elements.

### 4. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **HashMap**: It stores key-value pairs without any ordering of keys.
- **TreeMap**: It stores key-value pairs in **sorted** order based on the natural ordering of keys or a specified comparator.

### 5. **What is the `Iterator` in Java?**

**Answer**: An **Iterator** is an interface that allows iterating over a collection, providing methods like `hasNext()` and `next()`. It is used to traverse elements of a `List`, `Set`, or `Map`.

### 6. **What is the `PriorityQueue` in Java?**

**Answer**: A **PriorityQueue** is a queue where elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or a specified comparator. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.

### 7. **What is the difference between `List`, `Set`, and `Map` in Java?**

**Answer**:
- **List**: A collection that allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order.
- **Set**: A collection that does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee any order.
- **Map**: A collection that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

### 8. **What is the purpose of the `Deque` interface in Java?**

**Answer**: The **Deque** (Double-Ended Queue) interface represents a queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends. It can be used as a stack (LIFO) or a queue (FIFO).

### 9. **How do you remove an element from a `List` in Java?**

**Answer**: You can remove an element from a `List` using the `remove()` method.

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(10);
list.remove(Integer.valueOf(10)); // Removes the element 10
```

### 10. **What are Streams in Java?**

**Answer**: **Streams** are used for functional-style operations on collections. They allow operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing, and can process data in parallel.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 2 4
```

# Multithreading and Concurrency Cheat Sheet

### 1. **Introduction to Threads**

A **Thread** is a lightweight process in Java that allows for concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program. It is the smallest unit of execution, and multiple threads within a program can run simultaneously, making efficient use of CPU resources.

- Each thread has its own stack, but shares memory with other threads.
- Multithreading is used to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving the performance of applications, especially in CPU-bound tasks.

### 2. **Creating Threads**

There are two main ways to create threads in Java:

#### a. **Extending the `Thread` class**

To create a thread by extending the `Thread` class, you need to override the `run()` method. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread is started.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

#### b. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**

You can also create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface and overriding its `run()` method. This approach allows you to implement `Runnable` in a class that already extends another class.

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

### 3. **Thread Life Cycle**

A thread in Java goes through several stages during its life cycle:

1. **New**: The thread is created but not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run but the scheduler has not yet chosen it for running.
3. **Blocked**: The thread is blocked due to waiting for resources.
4. **Waiting**: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action.
5. **Timed Waiting**: The thread is waiting for a specified period.
6. **Terminated**: The thread has finished executing or has been killed.

```java
// Example of thread life cycle

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getState()); // Running state
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        System.out.println(thread.getState()); // New state
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

### 4. **Synchronization and Inter-Thread Communication**

#### a. **Synchronization**

Synchronization is used to prevent thread interference when multiple threads are accessing shared resources. It ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.

- **Synchronized methods**: You can synchronize a method by adding the `synchronized` keyword to it.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> counter.increment());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> counter.increment());
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

#### b. **Inter-Thread Communication**

Java provides methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` for inter-thread communication. These methods allow threads to communicate and cooperate with each other.

- **wait()**: Makes the current thread release the lock and wait until it is notified.
- **notify()**: Wakes up one thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
- **notifyAll()**: Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor.

```java
class SharedResource {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() throws InterruptedException {
        while (count > 0) {
            wait(); // Wait if count is greater than 0
        }
        count++;
        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
        notify(); // Notify other threads
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                resource.increment();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
        
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### 5. **Deadlock Prevention**

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever because each thread is holding a resource and waiting for the other to release it.

#### Deadlock Prevention Strategies:
- **Lock ordering**: Ensure that all threads acquire locks in the same order.
- **Timeouts**: Use timeouts to avoid waiting forever.
- **Avoid nested locks**: Try to avoid acquiring multiple locks at the same time.

```java
// Example of deadlock
class A {
    synchronized void methodA(B b) {
        b.last();
    }
    
    synchronized void last() {}
}

class B {
    synchronized void methodB(A a) {
        a.last();
    }
    
    synchronized void last() {}
}
```

### 6. **Thread Pooling**

A **thread pool** is a collection of worker threads that are kept ready to execute tasks. Using a thread pool helps manage threads more efficiently by reusing them instead of creating new ones every time a task is executed.

You can create a thread pool using the `ExecutorService` interface in Java.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 1 is being executed");
        });
        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 2 is being executed");
        });
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

# Interview Questions on Multithreading and Concurrency

### 1. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**

**Answer**: 
- A **process** is an independent program that runs in its own memory space.
- A **thread** is a lightweight process that shares the same memory space and resources as other threads in the same process.

### 2. **What is a deadlock in multithreading?**

**Answer**: A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever because each thread is waiting for the other to release a resource, causing a circular dependency.

### 3. **What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword in Java?**

**Answer**: The `synchronized` keyword is used to restrict access to a block of code or method to only one thread at a time, ensuring thread safety when accessing shared resources.

### 4. **What is the difference between `notify()` and `notifyAll()` in Java?**

**Answer**: 
- **`notify()`** wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
- **`notifyAll()`** wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor.

### 5. **How can you create a thread in Java?**

**Answer**: You can create a thread in Java by:
- Extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.
- Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing it to a `Thread` object.

### 6. **What is the thread life cycle in Java?**

**Answer**: The thread life cycle consists of several states:
- **New**: The thread is created.
- **Runnable**: The thread is ready to execute.
- **Blocked**: The thread is blocked and waiting for resources.
- **Waiting**: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action.
- **Terminated**: The thread has finished execution.

### 7. **What is thread pooling in Java?**

**Answer**: **Thread pooling** is a technique where a pool of worker threads is maintained to execute tasks. Instead of creating a new thread for each task, threads are reused, improving efficiency and performance.

### 8. **What are `wait()` and `notify()` methods in Java?**

**Answer**: 
- **`wait()`**: It is used to pause the execution of the current thread until it is notified by another thread.
- **`notify()`**: It is used to wake up one thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.

### 9. **What is the difference between `Runnable` and `Callable` in Java?**

**Answer**: 
- **`Runnable`**: Represents a task that can be executed by a thread, but does not return any result.
- **`Callable`**: Similar to `Runnable` but it can return a result and may throw an exception.

### 10. **What is the role of `ExecutorService` in Java?**

**Answer**: **`ExecutorService`** is an interface that provides a higher-level replacement for the `Thread` class. It manages the execution of tasks in a thread pool and provides methods to control the lifecycle of the threads.

# File Handling and Java I/O Cheat Sheet

### 1. **File Class and Its Methods**

The **File** class in Java represents files and directories. It is part of the `java.io` package and is used to create, delete, and check various file properties.

- **Constructor**: `File(String pathname)`
- **Common Methods**:
  - `exists()`: Checks if the file exists.
  - `createNewFile()`: Creates a new empty file.
  - `delete()`: Deletes the file or directory.
  - `length()`: Returns the size of the file in bytes.
  - `getName()`: Returns the name of the file or directory.
  - `isDirectory()`: Checks if the file is a directory.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("example.txt");

        if (file.exists()) {
            System.out.println("File exists");
        } else {
            try {
                file.createNewFile();  // Creates new file if not exists
                System.out.println("File created: " + file.getName());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **Reading and Writing Files (FileReader, FileWriter)**

The **FileReader** and **FileWriter** classes are used for reading and writing character data.

- **FileReader**: Reads data from a file as characters.
- **FileWriter**: Writes characters to a file.

#### FileWriter Example (Writing data to a file):
```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            writer.write("Hello, Java I/O!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### FileReader Example (Reading data from a file):
```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("output.txt")) {
            int character;
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) character);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Buffered Streams (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)**

**BufferedReader** and **BufferedWriter** are used to read and write data efficiently, especially for large files, by buffering the input and output.

#### BufferedReader Example (Reading from a file):
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### BufferedWriter Example (Writing to a file):
```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
            writer.write("Hello, BufferedWriter!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Serialization and Deserialization**

**Serialization** is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, while **Deserialization** is the process of converting a byte stream back into an object.

- **Serializable Interface**: Classes must implement this interface for serialization.
- **ObjectOutputStream**: Used for writing objects to a file.
- **ObjectInputStream**: Used for reading objects from a file.

#### Serialization Example:
```java
import java.io.*;

class Person implements Serializable {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

public class SerializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("person.ser"))) {
            Person p = new Person("John", 30);
            out.writeObject(p);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Deserialization Example:
```java
import java.io.*;

class Person implements Serializable {
    String name;
    int age;
}

public class DeserializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("person.ser"))) {
            Person p = (Person) in.readObject();
            System.out.println(p.name + " " + p.age);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 5. **NIO (New Input/Output) API**

Java NIO (New I/O) was introduced in Java 1.4 to provide a more scalable and flexible approach to file and network I/O operations.

#### Basic NIO Example (Reading from a file using Files class):
```java
import java.nio.file.*;

public class NIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Path path = Paths.get("output.txt");
            Files.lines(path).forEach(System.out::println);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 6. **Streams: Input and Output Streams**

Streams are used to perform input and output operations in Java. 

- **Input Stream**: Reads data from a source (file, network).
- **Output Stream**: Writes data to a destination (file, network).

#### Byte Streams (InputStream, OutputStream)

- **Byte Streams** work with raw binary data. Classes like `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` are byte-based.
  
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ByteStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
             FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) {
            int data;
            while ((data = input.read()) != -1) {
                output.write(data);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Character Streams (Reader, Writer)

- **Character Streams** handle character data. Classes like `FileReader` and `FileWriter` are character-based.

---

### 7. **Object Streams**

Object streams are used to read and write objects from and to streams. They use `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`.

---

### 8. **Data Streams**

**Data streams** allow you to read and write primitive data types (like `int`, `float`, etc.) in a machine-independent way. 

- **DataInputStream**: Used for reading primitive types.
- **DataOutputStream**: Used for writing primitive types.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.dat"));
             DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.dat"))) {
            out.writeInt(100);
            out.writeFloat(45.67f);

            System.out.println(in.readInt());
            System.out.println(in.readFloat());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 9. **Wrapper Classes**

Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive data types into objects.

- **Autoboxing**: Automatically converting primitive types to their corresponding wrapper class.
- **Unboxing**: Converting wrapper class objects back to primitive types.

```java
int x = 10;
Integer obj = x;  // Autoboxing
int y = obj;  // Unboxing
```

---

### 10. **Generics**

Generics allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters.

```java
class Box<T> {
    private T value;

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

---

### 11. **Enumeration (enum)**

An `enum` is a special data type that represents a group of constants.

```java
enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }
```

---

### 12. **Random Class**

The **Random** class is used to generate random numbers.

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class RandomExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        System.out.println(rand.nextInt(100));  // Random integer between 0 and 99
    }
}
```

---

### 13. **Scanner Class**

The **Scanner** class is used to read input from various sources, including user input.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
```

---

### 14. **StringTokenizer Class**

The **StringTokenizer** class is used to split strings into tokens (words or substrings).

```java
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class StringTokenizerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer("Java is awesome");
        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
            System.out.println(tokenizer.nextToken());
        }
    }
}
```
